        <h1>Welcome to Town Guide</h1>
        <p>
        Welcome to Town is a social deduction or murder mystery game server, heavily inspired by <i>Town of Salem,</i> in which players are randomly and privately assigned a faction and role. Each of these factions has its specific win conditions that players must work together to achieve, typically the elimination of another faction. But who can you trust? Because roles are secret, players often lie and fake claim roles to prevent themselves from being executed. It is up to you to deduce who is friend and who is foe.

        <h2>Day/Night Cycle</h2>
        <p>The game has a day/night cycle in which the game progresses. The cycle goes as following:</p>
	<h3 style="color: #ff6700;">The Morning</h3>
	<li>
	The Morning is when the day starts. Deaths are announced at this time. The Morning phase ends when all deaths have been announced.
	</li>
	<h3 style="color: #ff6700;">Discussion Phase</h3>
	<li>
	The Discussion Phase is a 24-hour period where living players may discuss who among them should be lynched. It is at this time that it is advised to share any information. Be careful what you believe, however.<br>
	This phase may be skipped if enough players request.
	</li>
	<h3 style="color: #ff6700;">Voting Phase</h3>
	<li>
	The Voting phase is when living players may choose to lynch a player. The phase ends when a player is lynched or when 12 hours have passed. There may be up to three trials in one day, but only one player may be lynched.
	</li>
	<h4 style="color: #ff6700;">Trial</h4>
	<li>
	When a player is on trial, they are given a moment to state their defense. After which, other plays may vote <i>Innocent</i> or <i>Guilty.</i> If a player does not vote, they will automatically <i>Abstain</i> and their vote will not be counted.<br>
	Once a player is found guilty, they may state their last words before they are executed, and their role and last will is revealed.
	</li>
	<h3 style="color: #ff6700;">Night</h3>
	<li>
	Night is where most of the action happens. Players may choose to preform their actions. The night ends once everyone has taken their action. This is the time to be afraid, as you might not survive.
	</li>
            </div>

            <div id="rulesPolicy" class="subtabcontent">
	<p>
	- Game-related information MUST be kept in-game. Do NOT use private messages to talk about the game.<br>
	- Images may be attatched to last wills, but may not be posted in Day Chat. Screenshots are allowed, but only of notifications given by Game Masters.<br>
	- Please do not intentionally throw the game. Doing so will result in instant punishment.<br>
	- To add on to above rule: Foul play (Example: Outing mafia/coven as recruited mafia/coven) will also result in instant punishment.<br>
	- Please do not abuse any unintended features. (For Example: Using channels all players may speak in to give information to the living as a dead player.)<br>
	- Please do not abuse loopholes in the rules and game mechanics.<br>
	- 3 full days of inactivity will result in your character being terminated, and a warning. Continuous inactivity will result greater punishment.
