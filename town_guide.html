        The Townies are the "good" side of Welcome to Town. Their aim is to "lynch every criminal and evildoer," referring to the rival factions that may harm the Town. These include: the Mafia, the Coven, Neutral Killing, Neutral Chaos (excluding Pirate), and the Witch, who cannot win with the Town. To that end, each innocent Town member contributes with varied abilities according to their roles and sub-alignments, which are categorized into Town Investigative, Town Killing, Town Protective, and Town Support. These sub-alignments can help the Town to be led to victory when working together to combine all their abilities.
    </p>

    <p>
        Compared to the other factions, the Town's primary method of elimination is by lynching their opponents in trials (due to their relative size in membership), keeping the majority of votes and power in numbers, as well as the abundance of intelligence gathering roles. Using the correct information and the Townies' majority, the evildoers will be lynched after voting.
    </p>

    <p>
        This doesn't mean the Townies lack the ability to directly kill their enemies, nor does it mean they are sitting ducks waiting to be killed should the lynching not go as smoothly as planned. The Town Killing and Town Protective roles are there precisely for this reason. But these roles most of the time can't reliably win the game for their fellow Townies, so active and accurate lynchings are still very much desired and necessary to win games.
    </p>

    <p>
        It is thus crucial for the Townies to accurately parse the truths from the lies, which their enemies will no doubt spread. It is also important for them to act and not be passive at trials before they lose their voting power to the evil-doers; as innocent Townies die almost every Night, their doom draws ever nearer.
