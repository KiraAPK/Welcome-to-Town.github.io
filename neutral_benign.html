    <h1>Neutral Benign</h1>

    </p>
    <p>The Neutral Benign (NB) alignment consists of three roles who have the ability to win with any faction in the game. Unlike Neutral Evil roles, however, Neutral Benign roles only focus on maintaining complete neutrality unless a situation arises where they must choose a side, in which they can become kingmakers on the right occasion - for example, when both factions know each other's identities but need an extra vote to lynch any of their opponents. </p>
    <p>Neutral Benign roles often face a lot of persecution from the Town because it is easy for evil roles to fake being one of them. Instances of an Amnesiac being shot by a Vigilante, executed by a Jailor, or lynched by the Town are common due to posing somewhat of a threat. </p>
    <p>A Neutral Benign role should remind the Town that these hostile actions do have an opportunity cost, however minor; that the wasted execution method could have been saved for an actual evildoer, that the Town had just wasted their time. If any Neutral Benign role manages to survive halfway through, they should be careful of how they act and who they vote for. If they draw too much attention to themselves, seem dangerous, hostile, or unwilling to eventually choose a side, opposing factions may turn and direct attention to them instead. </p>
    <p>Neutral Benign roles should also be cautious in announcing their chosen allies, as that can lead to persecution from other factions who would rather not deal with increased opposition. Remaining too quiet can also lead to accusations, as many evil roles often claim to be Neutrals to shield themselves.</p>
