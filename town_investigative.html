    <h1>Town Investigative (TI)</h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
        Town Investigative (TI) is the alignment of investigative roles that are sided with the Town. These roles are able to gather information on the roles, alignments, or actions of other players, which can help them judge which players are their allies and which are their enemies. It is important for these roles to have some sense of urgency and not be afraid to speak up when the Town has a lack of information.
    </p>

    <p>
        Deciding the best moment to come out and share information is just as important as deducing who the evil-doers are. A common mistake when playing these roles is to stay silent the whole game, even though the Town Investigative has crucial information that could win the game for the Town. This is mainly due to the fear of death from nightly visits; however, this is unlikely.
    </p>

    <p>
        All Town Investigative roles should always keep a Last Will, because when they die, the remaining Townies can use your information later on. The worst thing that could happen to a Town Investigative role is to be cleaned by a Janitor, to die on Night 1 and have no Medium, or to be forged by a Forger, so just be careful when someone else gets cleaned in the graveyard. Additionally, make sure to get your information out as soon as possible so it doesn't get lost.
    </p>

    <h3>Cooperation with the Town</h3>
    <p>
        It is also important to work with the Town to deduce who the evil-doers are, so cooperation is the key to winning. If you know a confirmed Townie, you can work with them to find the Mafia quickly, and you can also confirm other players. If no one is really confirmed yet, you should be careful of the players you trust so you can choose to investigate them.
    </p>

    <h3>Dealing with Evil Roles Impersonating TI</h3>
    <p>
        On the other hand, many roles who oppose the Town are heavily incentivized to pretend to be a Town Investigative role - it is an easy alignment to claim as information can easily be faked and it provides wiggle room when thought to be suspicious, especially Sheriffs, and in some cases, Psychics. Evil roles (especially the Executioner) like to do this to spread misinformation and potentially lead the Town to lynch someone who is innocent.
