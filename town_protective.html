    <h1>Town Protective (TP)</h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
        Town Protective (TP) is the alignment of protective roles that are sided with the Townies. Their main function is to protect other members of the Town- either by sacrificing themselves to kill an evil role, killing the attacker, or preventing a Townie from death via healing.
    </p>

    <p>
        The existence of this alignment is crucial in setting the evil-doers back by posing a threat, protecting important Town members such as the Mayor or Jailor, and turning every Night into a battle of wits among the protective roles and the evil-doers, such as the Mafia or Serial Killer.
    </p>

    <p>
        It is important for roles of this alignment to anticipate the victim of each Night and understand the risk in not protecting obvious options, like any confirmed Town role, especially roles such as the Jailor or Mayor. Currently, only five roles exist in this alignment: Doctor, Bodyguard, Crusader, Handler, and Trapper.
    </p>

    <p>
        Some Town Protective roles also have the ability to save themselves once every game. These two roles are Bodyguard and Doctor. This makes killing these roles difficult even if their identity has been compromised. However, you must use them wisely, as you only have one chance. If wasted, you may be killed later on.
    </p>

    <p>
        Generally, protecting the most obvious confirmed Town is the best option. While it is true that evils are unlikely to kill the most obvious target for protection, in almost all cases the cost of losing that important Town isn't worth taking the risk.
    </p>

    <p>
        Finding another Town Protective and protecting each other is a valuable tactic. Such example is a Doctor-Bodyguard combo. If the Bodyguard is attacked, the Doctor will heal them. If the Doctor is attacked, the Bodyguard will fight off the attacker, and the Doctor will save them from death. However, this takes away Town Protectives from other Roles that are important, like a Jailor.
