    <h1>Mafia</h1>
    <p> 
	<a href="index.html">Back</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        The Mafia are a faction of evildoers that serve as the primary enemy of the Town. All members have one common goal: to kill anyone that will not submit to the Mafia. Unlike the Town, the Mafia know who each other are from the beginning of the game. Every Mafia member has a unique function and unique attributes, much like the Town and Coven. However, there are a few major differences in numbers, since the Town primarily has multiple members at a time, while the Mafia can only have up to 4 members, similar to the Coven. Unlike the Coven, however, the Mafia can pose themselves as another normal Townie much easier. Their main intention is to eliminate every faction opposed to them, such as the Coven, Vampires, most Neutrals, and the Town. Despite the overall advantage in numbers within the Town, the Mafia's ability to consistently kill and intercept them can quickly back them into a corner, diminish their numbers, and by redirecting or concealing information; use their own noose against them, murdering and lynching each Townie one-by-one, until they have the primary majority over everyone else, including the vote to lynch.
    </p>

    <p>
        Unsurprisingly, many Townies will try to stand in their way. A suspicious Sheriff or Investigator can lead to their demise on the stand, and the Jailor or Vigilante won't hesitate to take them out with their ability to kill for the Town. Thus, the Mafia must kill off the Townies in the Night, while using their deception abilities to try and trick the Town during the Day. They must also be aware at all times, as the Town may outsmart them and reveal important information at any time, and end the Mafia in days.
    </p>
   <h1>Roles</h1>
    <p>
        <a href="godfather.html">Godfather</a>
    </p>
    <h1>General Strategy</h1>
	<ul>
	<li>You could put your name and role in your Last Will, along with other Mafia roles with names of people who aren't members of the Mafia. If you die, the Town might think you're throwing the game and lynch someone who's innocent, helping the Mafia win. This strategy only works against extremely inexperienced players, however. You may be reported for game-throwing, but it isn't as long as the names that are in your will are not Mafia.</li>
	<li>It is useful to talk a lot during the Day because usually members of the Mafia are very quiet. If you talk frequently, you draw attention, and people who draw attention have 'nothing to hide'.</li>
	<li>It is good to make up a role in advance in case you are asked or jailed.</li>
	<li>Against a Jailor, try to be as convincing as possible: Depending on your performance, the Jailor might execute you on the spot. Also, the Jailor will typically execute Neutral roles, so acting like a Jester is a bad idea.</li>
	<li>Against an Investigator, the role you claim must match the investigation if the Investigator has already proven their role. So for example, as an Ambusher, claim to be a Vigilante or Veteran. Veteran is a better claim because if the Town believes you are a Vigilante, they may ask you to shoot known members of the Mafia (but, beware! The Veteran is a Unique Role, so if you claim it, you will be called out if a real Veteran exists). A Consigliere should pick Investigator or Tracker, A Hypnotist should claim to be a Doctor, a Forger or Agent should claim to be a Lookout, and a Janitor should claim to be a Medium or Retributionist. Disguisers and the Godfather are less obvious cases. Since the Disguiser can change the results of others, you can claim anything (This can also work if a Hex Master has been confirmed to be in the town). A Disguised Mafia can claim to be a Doctor or any other role depending on what they come up as, since that hints the second target's role. However, claiming Doctor itself can get you executed by a Jailor or lynched for suspect of being a Serial Killer or Potion Master. The Godfather is mixed, they can either claim a role and say they have been Doused by an Arsonist, or they can claim to be a Bodyguard or Crusader, although these claims generally don't work.</li>
	<li>Lookout: They will know you are able to visit if they watch you visit someone. In most cases, you can refer to the strategy for Investigators. As a Consigliere or Disguiser, you should definitely claim a visiting role which is not noticeable (e.g. targets will know if they are roleblocked and/or blackmailed, but not if they were investigated).</li>
	<li>Sheriff: If you get found as suspicious; claim you might be framed or accuse the Sheriff of being an Executioner or an evil attempting to get an easy mislynch.</li>
	<li>Tracker: If you suspect that you are being tracked,, simply don't kill for that Night. Have another mafia member do the killing. Instead, do something that would back up your claim. For example, if you are claiming Doctor, visit a more important town member. The Tracker will see who you visited, and will hopefully think you are innocent.</li>
	<li>Psychic: If you are accused of coming up in an evil vision, claim a Town role and try to shift suspicion onto another person from the vision. If you come up twice, however, you could say your results were altered, or say they are an Executioner or a fake Psychic. Unfortunately, there aren't many ways to get out of this situation.</li>
	<li>Work to identify your allies.</li>
	<li>Executioners want to lynch a Townie, so it makes sense to support them; be careful about what you claim, since unlike them, you usually have to maintain plausibility even after their target is lynched and revealed as a Townie. If you do claim a Town Investigative role to support them, sometimes claiming to be a second Executioner with the same target after your lies are revealed can be helpful. You can identify Executioners by looking for people who seem to focus on accusing one target, especially if they accuse a non-member of the Mafia of being a member of the Mafia; however, be careful, since your Night-immune rivals like the Coven, Serial Killer, Werewolf, and Arsonist may sometimes pose as an Executioner to deflect attention. It's a good idea to try and get them lynched after they've hung their "target" or investigate them at Night, just in case.</li>
	<li>Jesters want to be lynched, which wastes the Town's time and (assuming all the Mafia votes innocent for them) can kill a Townie, Coven or a possible Neutral role. You can identify Jesters by looking for people who make claims you know to be false, such as claiming they were attacked on a Night you were roleblocked. It's best not to kill Jesters; they can distract the Town, Neutral Killing, and other evil rivals.</li>
	<li>Witches (as long as Coven cannot exist) and Changelings win with you, but can be very dangerous if they're targeting blindly; making contact with them is very important. Witches often claim to be a Lookout; other evil roles often do as well, but either way, it's a waste of time to attack them unless they are really a Lookout. You don't usually need to tell witches you are mafia, but by not telling the town you were controlled, they may be more likely to help you later. Additionally, since Witches win with all evil roles and need to last to the end, it can sometimes be worth just calling on Witches to identify themselves if doing so will result in you having a majority.</li>
	<li>Survivors want to survive, if you identify them, you may try to whisper and convince them that the Mafia has a better chance of winning than the Town. In return, you can promise them the Mafia won't attack said Survivor. In the best case, the Survivor will help you lynch the Town, the Coven or Neutral Killing roles in the late game, resulting in you having a majority.</li>
	<li>Amnesiacs want to remember a role. Amnesiacs are always a double-edged sword; they can be an enemy or an ally to the Mafia. If you know who they are, keep them alive for the time being. If they remember themselves as a dead Mafia member, Pirate, Neutral Benign, or Neutral Evil, they can become a quick ally. If they become a Townie or Coven, you can take them out swiftly. Worst case scenario is if they become a Neutral Killing or Plaguebearer, but by then your team can work a claim against them to get them lynched.</li>
	<li>Guardian Angels and Admirers: The Guardian Angel and Admirer both seek to ensure that their target survives until the end of the game. If the Guardian Angel/Admirer has one of the Mafia as their target, then you can whisper them to strike a deal. The Mafia will leave them alone or even defend them if they are accused, and in return, the Guardian Angel works with you and helps to defend their target, who is one of your teammates. This also works if the Guardian Angel/Admirer has any Survivors, Neutral Evil roles or a Pirate as their target, although it does depend on whether the neutral target of the Guardian Angel is willing to side with the Mafia. However, If the Guardian Angel/Admirer has a Town member, Coven member or a member of the Vampires as their target, you should eliminate them, as they are defending one of your enemies. Note that a Guardian Angel could be persuaded to help the mafia after their target dies, so it may be better to push for the death of their target. However, the Guardian Angel may not want to help you if you are the cause of their target's death.</li>
	<li>Pirates: The Pirate seeks to plunder two players. If you can identify who the Pirate is, you can whisper them, asking them not to plunder any of the Mafia, and in return, the Mafia will not attack them at Night. You could also try to appease the Pirate if they become a Kingmaker. You could use the fact that the Mafia left them alone all game and did not out them or attack them in order to try and get them to vote with you. Also, note that the Pirate may side with another faction over the Mafia. If they publicly announce that they are helping a faction other than yours during the Day, try to get them killed as soon as possible, either by murdering them at Night or convincing the Town to lynch the Pirate as they can kill Townies and as such must be eliminated.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Dealing with a Jailor</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>The Jailor is the most powerful Town role, and can single-handedly cost you the game if not dealt with. Therefore it is vital to identify and kill the Jailor as quickly as possible.</li>
	<li>Unless the Town screws up or you have a Consigliere, it may be very difficult to identify the Jailor directly. However, you can identify who is not the Jailor, and narrow your attacks down to people on that list to increase your chances of killing them.</li>
	<li>Sometimes, a Jailor will reveal Day 1 and ask for Town Protective roles and Lookouts to stay on them. In this case, it is very important to kill off the Town Protectives. Doctors and Handlers waste you a Night by undoing your kill, the Trapper, Bodyguard, and Crusader can get you killed (as well as preventing the Jailor's death), and a Lookout or Handler can out you as a member of the Mafia. A Blackmailer can give you targets to kill to vanquish the Jailor's protections. An Ambusher can assist in killing off the Town Protectives, but can also be easily outed if there's more than 1 visitor. For Lookouts, yeah you're kinda fucked lol</li>
	<li>Keep track of anyone who announces that they were jailed; it's extremely unlikely that the Jailor would lie about this (since whoever they really jailed would either call them out or need to know their identity), so you can usually scratch them off the list of possible Jailors. People who talk to the Jailor during the Day are probably not the Jailor, either, but a few Jailors might lie this way to deflect evil attention.</li>
	<li>Keep track of other evils, likely Jesters and Executioners, and anyone else who generally don't seem to be helping the Town. They're probably not the Jailor, either.</li>
	<li>Keep track of anyone whose role is known, either via Consigliere or some other source. Before attacking a known non-Jailor Townie, consider whether it's more important to kill them or to find the Jailor - you might be better off focusing on unknown people instead. The Consigliere should also follow these instructions to increase their chances of identifying the Jailor as quickly as possible.</li>
	<li>It's generally a bad idea to press the Jailor for their identity when jailed. Even if you've convinced them you're a Town Protective, Jailors will find it suspicious - and even if they do tell you their role, if you've claimed Town Protective, killing them will out that as a lie when their will pops up. You may, however, be able to tell them to signal you when they trust you with some secret code word or phrase, like "shrimp".</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Dealing with Evil Rivals</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Serial Killer: As the Serial Killer is an "every-Night" killer, it makes it easier to play as. If you find the Serial Killer early-on in a match, keep them alive for a bit, as your common enemy is the Town. If they start killing Mafia, it is late game, or you are in a struggle, it's best to out them, or, in serious situations, try getting them to attack your Godfather (who has Basic Defense) if one is available. This is risky if the Serial Killer has a fully-charged Bloodlust, though. Claiming Sheriff and finding them as suspicious is also a good claim.</li>
	<li>Arsonist: Arsonists have the power of dousing undetected, which can move onto your Mafia team. If you have a Godfather, he is useless against the Arsonist by himself. If you manage to find the Arsonist, it's best to out them as soon as possible, since some of your Mafia friends or you may be Doused.</li>
	<li>Werewolf: Dealing with a Werewolf can be a large struggle since it kills all its visitors, which can include your fellow members of the Mafia. If you find them through ways of their Defense value being higher than the Mafia's Attack value or a Consigliere, it's best to out them as soon as possible, especially during late game. You can also claim you are Sheriff and say they are suspicious during Full Moon.</li>
	<li>Vampire: Depending on the Game Mode, Vampires can be either a large, common threat or a small threat capable of being brought down. Vampires can be a problem, however, due to the fact they can spread undetected and kill all your Mafia members besides the Godfather. Finding Vampires and killing them can improve your team's survival. However, Vampires can also be used to distract the Town or trick them into lynching confirmed Townies if there is suspicion they have been converted.</li>
	<li>Coven: The Coven will be your major contenders in the battle for supremacy over the Town. The best strategy for the Mafia is to remove them as quickly as possible after identifying them, but you may try to let someone else kill (or just simply lynch) the Medusa as she will turn your fellow members or you into stone. If the Consigliere found a member of the Coven (except the Hex Master who might have hexed other roles), it's better for the Mafia Killing to kill them unless the Coven Leader, Witch or Medusa has the Necronomicon, in which case you need to lynch them. However, a Witch without it's barrier can easily be killed off.</li>
	<li>Plaguebearer: The Plaguebearer is initially not a major concern for the Mafia as they cannot directly kill your teammates, and it will take them a long time to infect everyone. If you discover their identity in the game's early stages, consider leaving them alone whilst you focus on your more powerful rivals at the start, such as the Town, the Coven, and any Vampires. However, if the Plaguebearer goes undetected for a long period of time, you run the risk that he will transform into Pestilence. If Pestilence emerges, and you cannot quickly find out who it is, the Mafia are doomed. Therefore, if you discover the identity of the Plaguebearer in the middle to late game stages, or if you discover the identity of the Pestilence, you should out them immediately as by then they pose a serious threat.</li>
	</ul>
        <h3>During the Day</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>If one of the members of the Mafia is being hanged and you cannot prevent it, vote guilty to avoid suspicion of being Mafia. This will also allow you to point out anyone who abstained or voted innocent as possible Mafia.</li>
	<li>If you recognize that an Executioner is trying to lynch someone, and the lynch vote comes, then vote innocent. This will make it seem more like you're a Townie. This has the potential downside of the Executioner siding against you, however. If the other killing roles, like Serial Killer, are dead, and the Town mob votes someone and you are sure they will vote guilty, then vote guilty as well (unless the Mafia vote would override guilty).</li>
	<li>It is important to avoid lynching a known Serial Killer too soon. They can help you double the deaths of Townies, as well as double your chances of killing any dangerous Townies. Try to find out who they are (by noting the people with Defense) but do not reveal it too soon. Towards the end, if many members of the Mafia are alive and you know who the Serial Killer is, you can lynch them. Otherwise, if you are confident you can win without them, write down in the Death Note that their Defense value is higher than your Attack value and kill someone else. The Death Note will be visible to the Town and since both the Town and the Mafia want the Serial Killer dead, it is very likely that the Town will vote them up. </li>
	<li>Remember however to play along with the Town. Try to behave the same way most Townies do, so as not to stick out. If for example, many Town members are ignoring a Last Will that says a specific other player is the Serial Killer, try not to draw too much attention while pointing them in that direction. This is especially true with your own Death Notes. If you use the Death Note to reveal sensitive information to the Town, don't start shouting about it the next Day in the chat. It will make the Townies suspect you as the writer of that note.</li>
	<li>It is very important to lynch all the Neutral Killing roles especially if there are 4 members of the Mafia because the Serial Killer and Werewolf can be a big threat while the Arsonist might burn the whole Mafia.</li>
	<li>Sometimes, enough members of the Mafia will stay alive that you have the majority, possibly including a Changeling or other Neutral. If the Town has no Vigilante, Jailor, or Mayor left alive, you can easily reveal yourself during the Day and lynch the remaining Townies one by one (without wasting time with Veterans, Town Protective, or dangerous Town Support roles).</li>
	<li>One of you pretends to be the Sheriff. If someone is immune to your attack, then say that they are Neutral Killing. If they are, then you will receive trust from the Town, and won't have to worry about getting lynched. Remember that the Executioner, Werewolf, Plaguebearer/Pestilence, and Arsonist are also immune. If you think you've identified the Werewolf, you can accuse them after a Full Moon Night, but you have to use the right accusation or the Town may grow suspicious. Another danger here is that whoever you attacked, they'll know they were hit by the Mafia, and will likely say so on the stand, which could get you hung the next Night (or even immediately if the Town cares more about hanging the Mafia than an immune role), which is why having a Consigliere or Agent search for them is advisable.</li>
	<li>Try to get the Jester lynched for an extra kill that Night. Just make sure the other members of the Mafia vote innocent.</li>
	<li>One risky strategy is to pretend to be an Executioner or Jester and accuse a fellow member of the Mafia, but with some flaw in your accusation (for instance, claiming to be an Investigator and saying that they came up as Mafia, rather than listing an investigative result that an Investigator would receive). This can accomplish several valuable things; if the Town believes you're an Executioner, they may assume your target is a Townie , whereas if they believe you're a Jester, they may ignore you. Even better, if your target later dies and is revealed as a Mafia, you can use your accusation to say that you're a "confirmed" Town Investigative, which may get some Townies to listen to you despite your 'mistakes' earlier on. This is risky, though, since you're calling attention to two members of the Mafia and could get shot by a Vigilante, executed by a Jailor, or hanged by a Jester-unwary Town for making a bad accusation; alternatively, the Town might not notice the flaw in your accusation and hang the accused member of the Mafia anyway.</li>
	<li>If during the Day, you seem absolutely certain to be lynched, and a Jailor is still alive, consider claiming Jailor. This should only be done when you feel absolutely certain you'll be lynched otherwise since it usually guarantees your execution by the real Jailor the next Night; you can often be caught out if people ask who you jailed. But it has several advantages that can benefit the surviving members of the Mafia: </li>
	<li>Townies often reflexively vote innocent on Jailor claims, giving the real Jailor a chance to deal with them; because Jailor is unique and the real Jailor can execute fake claims in this manner, even transparently false Jailor claims can sometimes make the Town pause due to the sheer rarity of people claiming it falsely. And if the Town does let the real Jailor handle it, this forces them to waste a Night and an execution dealing with you, which could have otherwise been spent elsewhere. If you have a Witch on your side, they can even make a guess at the real Jailor to save your life.</li>
	<li>If you do survive to the Night and get jailed, tell the Jailor that you are a Veteran trying to bait. Depending on the evidence against you, it may not be sufficient to save your life, but it's the most plausible explanation for why a Townie would falsely claim Jailor.</li>
	<li>Sometimes, the real Jailor might reveal to counter-claim you, exposing them to the Mafia.</li>
	<li>Since the Jailor is such a powerful claim, you can sometimes push to successfully lynch your main accuser; this also tends to make it more likely that the real Jailor will speak out, exposing themselves.</li>
	<li>In All Any, the Jailor might not even be present, allowing you to claim them safely; since the claim is still so risky, many Townies will reflexively accept it regardless of the evidence against you.</li>
	<li>Do not do this if you're the last surviving Mafia member, since there won't be anyone to benefit from your sacrifice.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>At Night</h3>
	<h4>Choosing a target to kill</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>If someone is being accused of being Mafia and they are not, not killing them will waste the Town's time investigating them at Night or questioning them during the Day. On the other hand, killing them may redirect suspicion to the accuser. Even better, killing their accuser may increase suspicion on them; however, it risks wasting one of your kills hitting an Executioner or Jester.</li>
	<li>If you have someone trying to lynch you, don't kill them too soon. It would be too obvious. However, if you wait too long, then you might get lynched because you let that person convince the Town to lynch you. Additionally, if they're a genuine Investigator or Sheriff, it might be better for you to simply bite the bullet and kill them as soon as possible even if it gets one of you hung rather than leaving them alive to potentially discover the rest of the Mafia.</li>
	<li>If there is a Jailor, you can sometimes choose not to kill anyone: it will seem like the jailed person is the Godfather or Mafioso. Note that there are other possibilities for this, such as hitting a target with Basic Defense.</li>
	<li>Try killing the person who is least expected to be killed. If someone says, "I'm an Investigator/Sheriff/Doctor/or any Town role in fact", Don't kill them. The Lookout might catch you doing it; the Doctor might heal them; they may be a Veteran trying to lure you in, and so on; the Bodyguard, Crusader, or Trapper might protect them which can result in your death.</li>
	<li>The Mafia benefits by having a complacent or distracted Town. Therefore, you should generally avoid killing people who obviously seem to be wasting the Town's time with false accusations, off-topic arguments and so on. Often, they'll turn out to be Jesters or Executioners anyway. Conversely, it's often a good idea to kill people who seem too competent or directed.</li>
	<li>If you get accused and people vote for you, but they don't manage to get you up to the stand, it can be dangerous to kill your accuser; but people are less likely to notice if you kill the voters.</li>
	<li>The Town, the Coven and Vampires are the biggest threat to the Mafia. Try focusing on eliminating them first unless Neutral Killing and/or Pestilences gets in the way.</li>
	<li>The Jailor is the most dangerous member of the Town, so you should make it a priority to find them. One way to go about this is to skip anyone who you know isn't the Jailor - if you eliminate your fellow Mafia, plus anyone who has claimed another role, plus anyone who has been seen visiting or otherwise identified as a non-Jailor by investigators, there usually aren't many options left in the late game. For this reason, it's often also worth skipping people identified by your Consiglieres unless it is someone you absolutely must kill immediately.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Using the chat</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>The Mafia's greatest strength is knowing their allies and being able to talk to them privately at Night. If someone in the Mafia is being accused of being Mafia, you can team up with the other Mafia to invent "proof" that they are innocent; e.g. claiming that you role blocked your teammate, have been healed by a member of the Mafia, etc. This will cause the remaining Townies to be unsure who is lying, giving you time (or possibly lynching a Townie) until the Town does not have the numbers to lynch you anymore. However, this must be done with care, since if your story falls apart, you might all get revealed. If you don't feel you can defend a fellow member of the Mafia successfully, lynch them anyways so you don't seem suspicious to the rest of the Town.</li>
	<li>If you die and the Medium is still alive, then tell them the names of people who are Mafia (but really aren't). Since you can still see the Mafia log when you're dead, check first to see who the Mafia is going to kill, and call other people as Mafia. But advanced and experienced players are harder to trick, as they don't trust the Mafia. If you name someone as Mafia but then they die, and it's revealed they are Town, then the Medium will likely not believe you if you give out false information again.</li>
	<li>You may have better luck falsely telling them that someone is a Coven member or Neutral Killing role; you can claim that they're immune or that your Consigliere identified them. A Medium is more likely to believe you on this because it would make sense for you to reveal enemies that are shared between the Mafia and the Town.</li>
	</ul>
