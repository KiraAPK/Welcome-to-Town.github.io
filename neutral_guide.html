    <h1>Neutral</h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>Neutral roles have but one certain allegiance - themselves. Instead of wanting all evil-doers killed like the Town, or to kill all opposition like the Mafia and Coven, Neutrals have a diverse set of goals each unique to different roles. The types of goals further divide the Neutrals into 4 subcategories (alignments): Neutral Benign, Neutral Chaos, Neutral Evil, and Neutral Killing. </p>
    <p>The Neutral Killing and Neutral Chaos alignments (Not including Pirate Pirate) are special in that the included roles are all considered factions of a single role. While the Town, the Mafia, and the Coven consist of multiple diverse roles, these Neutral factions only have one individual role within them. Because only one faction can win in each game, the existence of one or multiple Neutral faction could create a Mexican standoff where no single faction wishes to act aggressively against one opposing faction, fearing opportunistic strikes from third parties. </p>
    <p>Most often, there is only one of a specific Neutral Killing role. This not only limits their ability to use lynch trials effectively, but it also means they lack all the utilities that other factions have due to their supportive members. However, it would be a mistake to write these killers off as irrelevant. What they lack in quantity and variety, they make up in sheer firepower: by strategically killing the right players. At Night, these loners can emerge victorious among the conflict between the Town, the Mafia, and the Coven. Vampires are similar to the Neutral Killing in which they are their own faction and have few members, but prefer a more subtle approach instead of killing during the Night. Vampires, unlike the Neutral Killings, will also know each other. </p>
    <p>Furthermore, the Neutrals are also unique in that it contains non-factional roles; roles that are capable of winning with a faction that is not their own. These are the Neutral Evil and Neutral Benign roles. The former can win with almost anyone, but are typically detrimental to the Town; the latter can aid and win with anyone and can help the faction they choose to side with. This quality makes Neutral Evil and Neutral Benign roles potential kingmakers. The Pirate role is also non-factional and may win with anyone, despite being a Neutral Chaos role. </p>
    <p>Note that factional roles will always win if their faction wins, even if said role is dead. This is a luxury non-factional roles do not have. Death will impact non-factional roles differently, depending on the role in question. </p>
    <p>Neutrals, most of the time, have the least presence in most typical game modes (only one Witch and Executioner in Ranked), and some of them will only show up as an Any role. Because of this, they likely contain the least understood roles for newcomers to the game. They are, however, quite common in All Any.</p>
    <p>Neutral Benign and especially Neutral Evil aligned roles generally have to rely on other factions in order to win. As a result, it is usually very unlikely they will win all by themselves, more likely being used by other factions for an extra vote or information, among other things. Because there are no Neutral Benign roles in Ranked and Ranked Practice, it is usually up to the Executioner/Jester to help out the Mafia in these game modes. For example, the Witch can help the Mafia by controlling Town members to kill each other (a good example being controlling a Vigilante into shooting a revealed Mayor) and by whispering their controlled targets' role to the Mafia members. In other game modes, the Survivor and Amnesiac usually side with a faction that they think will win, subsequently increasing their own chance of winning. A Guardian Angel will usually side with their target's faction, even if they become an Amnesiac.</p>
