    <h1>Neutral Evil</h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>The Neutral Evil (NE) alignment consists of four non-factional Neutral roles that have varying degrees of conflicting interests against the innocent Townies, and wish to have a certain person or group of people killed. Most Neutral Evil roles are unable to cause death itself but can manipulate and force actions against other factions to cause death, such as the Jester haunting someone after being lynched, the Executioner tricking the Town into lynching their target, or the Witch forcing roles to visit or attack others to cause death. </p>
    <p>Surprisingly, it is possible to form alliances as Neutral Evil roles. In fact, It's possible they need to in order to win. For example, they could team with the Mafia or Coven to gather enough votes in trials, with Neutral Killing roles to eliminate opposing voices, or with each other so to amplify the misinformation that they all wish to spread. Some of them could even team up with the Town on infrequent occasions, but this is a riskier proposition for both sides of the deal. However, they can also work alone and try to lay low for most of the game; this is true especially for Jester and Executioner. </p>
    <p>Being non-factional, death is an interesting part of the Neutral Evil alignment; as unlike factional roles, Neutral Evil roles cannot win while dead by way of their faction's victory, for they have none. Thus, the function of death must be specified on a per-role basic: To be eligible to win, the Jester must be lynched, the Witch must live to see the Town lose, and the Executioner only requires their Town or possible Vampire target to be lynched.</p>
    <p>The Neutral Evil alignment contains a unique relevance in lynching. Two of its roles, the Jester and the Executioner, need to utilize lynch trials to win. These are the only roles to have such stipulations, and their existence and potential presence in the game often leads to disorderly trials. The odd roles out here, the Witch and Changeling, don't have to fiddle with the trials to win (Although they must be lynched if there is a Vigilante with bullets left alive). But to compensate, the Witch and Changeling are the only non-factional roles that cannot win with the Town. Whatever the role is, if there is a Neutral Evil role in play, it's extra work for the Townies, thereby giving other factions an advantage as there is a distraction now in place. </p>
    <p>While rare, it is possible for two of the Neutral Evils: (Jester and Executioner) to work with the Town. The Jester, after being lynched, might end up haunting an enemy of theirs (such as the Serial Killer) and the Executioner can vote with them, or, if their target is converted into a Vampire, may inadvertently lynch a now evil-sided Townie. The Executioner is the most likely to do so after lynching their target and may even go as far as to strike a deal with the Town to lynch their target in return for the Executioner's vote. </p>
