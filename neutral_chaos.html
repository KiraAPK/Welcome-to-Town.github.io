    <p>The Neutral Chaos (NC) alignment is the group of people within the Town that have a main goal: cause chaos. Each role has separate goals that vary on their mission, and every one of them can be a major threat to all factions. Vampires, for instance, can easily spread undetected and wipe out the Coven or Mafia and diminish the Town with their own majority. However, Neutral Killing is their main rival due to them being immune to anything from a Vampire. Pirates have their own goals. Wanting to plunder players, they can cause easy conflict being able to block their targets from using their actions, while at the same time being able to kill them easily with a simple structure. Even after completing their goal, they can easily kill other foes who may pose a threat to them, while staying completely benign on which faction they choose overall.</p>
    <p>However, one role stands out: the Plaguebearer. The Plaguebearer's ability is to infect others and withstand the most common of attacks. Their goal is to infect the entire Town and evolve to their other form, Pestilence, Horseman of the Apocalypse. In this form, they can Attack anyone they choose with their Rampage ability along with anyone who visits them. The immunity to everything at Night surely means terror to all. However, those with the ability to protect their simple targets can ward off the Pestilence for hopefully long enough to determine their identity and bring them down with the only option the Town has: lynching. The noose is one thing all evils, especially the most chaotic ones, all fear. </p>
    <p>Pirates can win with the Town, but must achieve two successful plunders to do so. Working with them as a Townie may be beneficial, but once the Pirate has won the game, who they choose to side with is up to them. Regardless of what happened in-game, a Pirate may choose to win with anyone they wish, Town or not. </p>
