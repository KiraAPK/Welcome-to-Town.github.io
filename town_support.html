    <h1>Town Support</h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
        Town Support (TS) is the alignment of roles who are sided with the Townies that can contribute with different abilities that do not fit into the other alignments (​​Town Killing, Town Protective, and Town Investigative). It should be noted that some of these roles can cause or prevent death at Night, or gather non-circumstantial information, but never via themselves directly, nor with complete certainty.
    </p>
    <p>
	Due to the peculiar nature of this alignment, Town Support roles can often prove themselves through the use of their telling abilities, which is useful information for the Town to use. It also makes it harder for evils to claim roles such as Tavern Keeper
    </p>
    <p>
	Town Support roles tend to have the most impact in the late-game as once they have the information they can devastate players using some of the most powerful abilities in the game (a Tavern Keeper could potentially prevent the Mafia from killing or narrow down suspects).
    </p>
    <p>
	On the other hand, if used incorrectly, some Town Support can devastate the Town. (e.g. a Tavern Keeper could prevent a Sheriff from gathering information, or prevent a Doctor from healing). 
    </p>
    <h2> General Strategy </h2>
    <ul>
	<li>If you have an ability that has a noticeable effect (i.e. Tavern Keeper) in any game with a Town majority, it is a good idea to use your abilities so that Town knows your role exists.</li>
	<li>However, be aware that this also alerts the Mafia, Coven and/or Neutral Killing roles to your presence, which can make you a target if you're forced to claim.</li>
	<li>Even though you may feel your role is useless, keep an updated Last Will as you are never useless. Tavern Keepr last visits for potential Werewolves, Mediums should keep dead Town Investigative results and anything else important said in chat, and Retributionists should keep track of who they resurrect and results if any.</li>
	<li>Town Supports tend to be very effective late game rather than the early game. Mediums spike in the middle, but all other roles are incredibly useful late game. Keep this in mind.</li>
	<li>Evils normally won't kill off Town Supports before any other Town alignments, so a Town Support claim, especially Medium, is unlikely to result in your immediate death.</li>
    </ul>
